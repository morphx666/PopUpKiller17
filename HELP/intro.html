  <p><font face="Verdana" size="1">Aren't you tired of all those annoying 
	sponsors PopUp's that get displayed when you visit some WEB sites?</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana" size="1">PopUp Killer is the original and most 
	powerful popups destroying- machine ever created.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana" size="1">With PopUp Killer you will be able to 
	browse the web without being molested by those annoying ads that popup when 
	you visit some web sites.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana" size="1">With features such as the Smart! engine, 
	PopUp Killer can identify possible popups and close them even before you can 
	see them.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana" size="1">You can also control the amount of browser 
	windows you permit to be opened at the same time, feature that becomes 
	really handy when browsing really annoying sites that open new pages when 
	you close a browser window.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana" size="1">PopUp Killer is also fun, because you can 
	configure it to produce sounds when it kills a popup.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana" size="1">This new release is even able to kill the 
	new GeoCities box and close those annoying dialogs presented by some web 
	sites that force you click on them to continue.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana" size="1">Since early 1994, PopUp Killer has been the 
	most advanced and featured popup killing machine... but of course, the only 
	way for you to experience how powerful it is, and how much have you been 
	missing for not using it, is to download it and run it for a test drive. 
	We're sure you'll be surprised!</font></p>
